# Environment Tracker

A program using a sensor hat on a raspberry pi to take and log environmental readings indoors.

## About

Uses a Raspberry Pi B with a Environment Sensor HAT from Waveshare. The code takes readings on set interval or on HTTP requests. The implemented parameters are temperature, humidity, pressure, uv, voc, and light. I use it for taking readings which will be sent to https://exist.io/ (eventually).
